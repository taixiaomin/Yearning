## ‚ú® Features

- **AI Assistant**: Our AI assistant offers real-time SQL optimization suggestions, enhancing SQL performance. It also supports text-to-SQL conversion, allowing users to input natural language and receive optimized SQL statements.
  
- **SQL Audit**: Create SQL audit tickets with approval workflows and automated syntax checks. Validate SQL statements for correctness, security, and compliance. Rollback statements are automatically generated for DDL/DML operations, with a comprehensive history log for traceability.

- **Query Audit**: Audit user queries, restrict data sources and databases, and anonymize sensitive fields. Query records are saved for future reference.

- **Check Rules**: Our automated syntax checker supports a wide range of check rules, suitable for most automatic checking scenarios.

- **Privacy Focused**: Yearning is a locally deployable, open-source solution that ensures the security of your database and SQL statements. It includes encryption mechanisms to protect sensitive data, ensuring it remains secure even if unauthorized access occurs.

- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: Create and manage roles with specific permissions, restricting access to query work orders, auditing functions, and other sensitive operations based on user roles.
